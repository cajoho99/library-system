# Library system
This is supposed to be a library system that can keep track of a book case.
It could be used for a snIT bookcase and keep track of people borrowing books.
It could also be used to keep track of locations of books at home and people who have borrowed the books.

Parts:

* Backend that keeps track of all books.
* CLI application to interact with the backend.
* Graphical frontend for the books.
* Potential IT fork.
